**English | [Русский](README_RU.md)**

Hey there! My name is **Denny**, and I ran into a problem with my agent burning through too many tokens just to put together daily digests. Spending over $50 a month on all the unnecessary and sometimes outright wrong actions of an agent running off a plain SKILL.md was something I couldn't afford, so I came up with the idea for Multi-Parser — let pure code handle the parsing, and let the agent work with ready-made data in a convenient format.
> I went into more detail about this issue in these two posts: [Post-1](https://t.me/dennyfun/300) and [Post-2](https://t.me/dennyfun/301).


## Why Multi-Parser?

Multi-Parser was built as a **cheap and deterministic replacement** for an AI agent's daily digest [skill](https://github.com/draco-agent/tech-news-digest). Instead of burning LLM tokens on fetching, filtering, and deduplicating news, this pipeline does everything in pure Python — no LLM calls, no hallucinations, no wasted spend.

**The parser and the agent work separately** — that's the core idea and guiding principle of this project. It was important to draw a clear line of responsibility between pure code and the agent's work. The pipeline writes structured data to PostgreSQL, and the agent only queries the database when it's time to compose a digest. This means zero extra tokens spent on data collection — the agent only uses tokens for the final summary and delivery.

> Agent configuration for working with this pipeline will be published in a separate repository.

## What It Does

Multi-Parser collects AI-related news from **93 sources**, scores quality, deduplicates, and stores everything in PostgreSQL. I hand-picked sources that tend to write in-depth content rather than just two sentences in a tweet. Spammy, flooding, and reply-only accounts didn't make the cut.

| Source Type | Count | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| RSS | 21 | MIT Technology Review, Hugging Face, OpenAI, Google DeepMind Blog, NVIDIA AI... |
| Twitter/X | 45 | @karpathy, @sama, @demishassabis, @ilyasut, @AndrewYNg... |
| GitHub | 19 | LangChain, vLLM, DeepSeek, Llama, Ollama, Open WebUI... |
| Reddit | 8 | r/MachineLearning, r/LocalLLaMA, r/artificial... |
| Web Search | topic-based | Brave Search or Tavily API with freshness filters |

I especially focused on sources that don't just rehash the news (all of Twitter is guilty of this), but produce original thoughts or ideas, or are the de facto primary source.

## Pipeline

The pipeline is dead simple and starts with a regular cron job that runs Python scripts for each source on a schedule. Then other scripts filter, deduplicate, and score the quality of the parsed data, after which a final JSON file is produced and inserted into the database.
```

   │     merged JSON output
   ├── store-merged.py → PostgreSQL (articles + seen_urls)
   └── pipeline_runs → UPDATE (status='ok')
```

### Quality Scoring

The project has a scoring system to ensure that only fresh and relevant news has the highest chance of making it into the final digest.

| Signal | Score | Condition |
|---|---|---|
| Cross-source | +5 | Same story from 2+ source types |
| Priority source | +3 | Key blogs/accounts |
| Recency | +2 | Published < 24h ago |
| Twitter engagement | +1 to +5 | Tiered by likes/retweets |
| Reddit score | +1 to +5 | Tiered by upvotes |
| Duplicate | -10 | Same URL already seen |
| Already reported | -5 | URL in seen_urls (last 14 days) |

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Bare minimum:
- A small Linux server (VPS)
- At least one API key for Twitter or web search (optional but recommended)

For Twitter, I recommend using the affordable [twitterapi.io](http://twitterapi.io/?ref=dennybeus) service.
For web search, I use the free API from [tavily.com](https://app.tavily.com/home).

### Environment Variables Setup

All API keys are optional. The pipeline can work with whatever you have, but I strongly recommend adding the following to your `.env` file:
- `TWITTERAPI_IO_KEY`
- `TAVILY_API_KEY` (1,000 free tokens per month)
- `GITHUB_TOKEN` (bypasses rate limits)

And make sure to edit these fields:
- `POSTGRES_USER` (replace `user` at the end of multi_parser_user with your name)
- `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` (set your own password)
- `DATABASE_URL` (replace multi_parser_user and changeme with your `POSTGRES_USER` and `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` respectively)

```bash
# =============================================================================
# Postgres — must match values in docker-compose.yml
# =============================================================================
POSTGRES_DB=multi_parser
POSTGRES_USER=multi_parser_user
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=changeme

# DATABASE_URL is derived from the three variables above:
# postgresql://<POSTGRES_USER>:<POSTGRES_PASSWORD>@127.0.0.1:5432/<POSTGRES_DB>
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://multi_parser_user:changeme@127.0.0.1:5432/multi_parser

# =============================================================================
# Twitter/X  (at least one recommended)
# =============================================================================
GETX_API_KEY=
TWITTERAPI_IO_KEY=
X_BEARER_TOKEN=

# =============================================================================
# Web search  (at least one recommended)
# =============================================================================
BRAVE_API_KEYS=
TAVILY_API_KEY=

# =============================================================================
# GitHub  (optional — improves rate limits)
# =============================================================================
GITHUB_TOKEN=
```

### Automated Setup (VPS / Linux)

So you don't have to type out every command by hand, I made a convenient one-shot setup script `run-setup.sh` that will handle the following for you:

1. Install `python3-pip`, `docker.io`, `docker-compose`, `apparmor`
2. Add the current user to the `docker` group
3. Install Python dependencies from `requirements.txt`
4. Start PostgreSQL 16 via Docker Compose
5. Apply database migrations
6. Validate config
7. Set up cron (05:00 and 17:00 UTC daily)

All you need to do is run the following commands:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone git@github.com:DennyBeus/multi-parser.git
cd multi-parser

# 2. Configure environment variables
cp .env.example .env
nano .env    # at minimum, set POSTGRES_PASSWORD and DATABASE_URL

# 3. Run setup (installs deps, starts Postgres, applies migrations, sets up cron)
chmod +x run-setup.sh
./run-setup.sh
```

The script is idempotent, meaning it's safe to run multiple times.

### Manual Setup

You can also run all the commands yourself by following the setup guide in [SETUP.md](SETUP.md), but the `run-setup.sh` script mentioned above does exactly the same thing.

## Configuration

### Sources & Topics

- `config/defaults/sources.json` — 93 built-in sources (21 RSS, 45 Twitter, 19 GitHub, 8 Reddit) that you can add, remove, and edit directly through your agent or manually on the server.
- `config/defaults/topics.json` — topic definitions with search queries and filters. Currently there's only one topic, `ai`, but you can add new ones matching your interests through the same agent.
> You don't even need to restart the project — all changes take effect immediately since all scripts run exclusively via cron.

### Cron Schedule

Default: every 24 hours (06:00 UTC). Edit in `run-setup.sh` before running:

```bash
CRON_SCHEDULE="0 6 * * *"
```

## Database

PostgreSQL 16 (Docker), 3 tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `pipeline_runs` | Tracks each cron execution (timing, status, error) |
| `articles` | Merged/scored articles per run (UNIQUE on run_id + normalized_url) |
| `seen_urls` | Cross-run deduplication — replaces archive scanning |

Auto-cleanup: articles older than 90 days and seen_urls older than 180 days are removed after each pipeline run.

Memory tuning for 4GB RAM VPS is pre-configured in `docker-compose.yml` (256MB shared_buffers, 20 max connections).

## Project Structure

After the first pipeline run, a `/logs/` folder will be created in the project root where task statuses are recorded after each cron trigger. I intentionally placed this folder inside the project so that the future agent can more easily find and explain where the project logs are, and so they don't get mixed up with logs from other programs, as would happen with a system directory like `/tmp/`.

## Origin

Multi-Parser is a reworked fork of [draco-agent/tech-news-digest](https://github.com/draco-agent/tech-news-digest) that I turned into a super cost-effective solution suitable for any user, where anyone can customize my setup to their needs or keep scaling the parser for their own AI agent.
